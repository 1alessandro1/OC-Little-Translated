# Turning off Bluetooth and WiFi during Sleep

## Introduction
**SleepWatcher** is a command line tool (daemon) for macOS that monitors sleep, wakeup and idleness of a Mac. It can be used to execute a Unix command when the Mac or the display of the Mac goes to sleep mode or wakes up, after a given time without user interaction or when the user resumes activity after a break or when the power supply of a Mac notebook is attached or detached. 

It also can send the Mac to sleep mode or retrieve the time since last user activity. A little bit knowledge of the Unix command line is required to benefit from this software. For Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.4, use SleepWatcher 2.0.5 (and sources). For Mac OS X 10.1 and 10.2, download SleepWatcher 1.0.1. 

This is a MAC script to turn off Bluetooth WIFI when you sleep and turn on Bluetooth WIFI when you wake up. You only need to execute this script once to turn off Bluetooth WIFI when you sleep.
