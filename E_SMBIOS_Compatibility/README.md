## SMBIOS Compatibility Table

Check the following spreadsheet to find out which SMBIOS is natively supported by which versions of macOS:

**NOTES**
This list, although helpful and informative, is not as binding for hackintoshes as it is for real Macs, because…

- …on Hackintoshes, you can use different SMBIOSes to run newer versions of macOS on officially unsupported CPUs.
- …you can run older versions of OSX/macOS on newer CPUs which are not supported by the chosen OSX/macOS by utilizing Fake CPU-IDs.
- …you can make use of macOS Monterey's virtualization capabilities to spoof a supported SMBIOS but let the hardware run on the intended SMBIOS for your CPU! Check my [**Boad-ID VMM spoof guide**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/09_Board-ID_VMM-Spoof) to find out how it works.
