# OpenCore Calculators Spreadsheet

This includes a spreadsheet in Number and Excel Format for calculating the correct `ScanPolicy` and `PickerAttributes` for OpenCore based on the data provided in the Documentation.pdf included in the OpenCore Package.

I plan to include a calculator for csr-active-config at some stage but I have to figure out if and how this is calculated first.
