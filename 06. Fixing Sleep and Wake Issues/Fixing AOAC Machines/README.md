# AOAC General Description

## AOAC Technology

A new technology, namely *Always On/Always Connected* (AOAC) was introduced by Intel and is designed to maintain network connectivity and data transfer while the computer is in sleep or hibernation mode. Simply put, the introduction of `AOAC` makes laptops like our cell phones, never shut down and always online.

### How to determine if you have an `AOAC` Machine

- Open [MaciASL](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL/releases)
- Click on "File > New From ACPI" and select `FACP.aml`
- Search for `Low Power S0 Idle`. If it is = `1`, it is an `AOAC` machine. For example:

  ```asl
  Low Power S0 Idle (V5) : 1
  ```

For more information about `AOAC`, please refer to the search option of your choice and look for `AOAC`, `Lenovo AOAC`, `AOAC NIC`, etc.

## AOAC Problems

### Sleep Issues

- Due to the contradiction between `AOAC` and `S3` itself, machines with `AOAC` technology do not have `S3` sleep function, such as `Lenovo PRO13`. Such a machine will **Sleep Fail** once it enters `S3` sleep. **Sleep failure** is mainly manifested as: it cannot be woken up after sleep and appears to be dead, and can only be forced to shut down. The essence of **sleep failure** is that the machine stays in the sleep process and never sleeps successfully.
- See the ACPI Specification for `S3` sleep aspects.

### Standby Issues

Although **Disabling `S3` sleep** solves the **sleep failure** problem, the machine will no longer sleep which produces another problem: the absence of sleep reduced the standby time in battery-powered mode. For example, in the case of "menu sleep", "auto sleep", "box cover sleep", etc., the battery power consumption is about 5% to 10% higher per hour.

## Fixing AOAC

- Disable `S3` sleep
- Turn off the power supply of the solo display
- Power Idle Management
- Choose better quality SSD: SLC>MLC>TLC>QLC (not sure)
- Update SSD firmware if possible to improve power management performance
- Enable APST for SSDs using NVMeFix.kext
- Enable ASPM (if you can't enable it in the BIOS directly, see Chapter 16 to patch it in)

## AOAC Sleep, Wake

- `AOAC` Sleep
- The above scheme can make the machine sleep, this sleep is called `AOAC` sleep . The essence of `AOAC` sleep is that the system and hardware have entered an idle state, not `S3` sleep in the traditional sense.

- `AOAC` Wakeup

  Waking up a machine after it enters `AOAC` sleep can be difficult and usually requires the power button to wake it up. Some machines may require the power button + `PNP0C0D` method to wake up the machine.

## AOAC Patch

- Control Bluetooth WIFI - see "Sleep automatically turn off Bluetooth WIFI", thanks to @i5 ex900 0.66%/h Huaxing OC Dreamn for the method

## Caution

- The `AOAC` solution is a temporary solution. With the widespread use of `AOAC` technology, there may be a better solution in the future.
- Since `AOAC` sleep/wake is different from `S3` sleep/wake, the following patches are not applicable:
  - [PTSWAKTTS Patch](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/06.%20Fixing%20Sleep%20and%20Wake%20Issues/PTSWAK%20Sleep%20and%20Wake%20Fix)
  - [PNP0C0E Sleep Fix](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/06.%20Fixing%20Sleep%20and%20Wake%20Issues/PNP0C0E%20Sleep%20Correction%20Method)
- For the same reason as above, `AOAC` sleep does not show the working status correctly, such as no breathing light blinks during sleep.
- You can also try this method for non-AOAC machines.
