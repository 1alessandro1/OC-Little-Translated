# ACPI Debugging
## Description
By adding debug code to ***SSDT-xxxx*** Hotpatches, it is possible to check the working status of an ACPI table on the console for debugging.

## Requirements
To enable ACPI Debugging, you must install a kext and a SSDT:

1. **Kext**: install `ACPIDebug.kext` to `OC\Kexts` and update the `config.plist`.
2. **Patches**:
	- Add `SSDT-RMDT.aml` to `OC\ACPI` and update the config.plist. It adds a `RMDT` (RehabMan Debug Trace) device to your system.
	- Add debugging code for parameters you want to check to your SSDT(s) (See `SSDT-BKeyQxx-Debug.dsl` for example).
3. **Reboot**

## Debugging
- Open **Console** and search for **`keyword`** (**`keyword`** as defined in the debug section of your SSDT(s), in this example `ABCD-`)
- Check the console output

## Example
To observe `_PTS` and `_WAK` of `ACPI` receiving `Arg0` after the machine sleeps and wakes up.

- Kext and Patches:
  - ***ACPIDebug.kext***
  - ***SSDT-RMDT***
  - ***SSDT-PTSWAK*** &rarr; This patch has built-in parameter passing variables `\_SB.PCI9.TPTS`, `\_SB.PCI9.TWAK`, which are convenient for other patches. See [**PTSWAK Sleep and WakeFix**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/04_Fixing_Sleep_and_Wake_Issues/PTSWAK_Sleep_and_Wake_Fix).
  - ***SSDT-BKeyQxx-Debug*** - This patch is just an example. Debug code is added within the patch to be able to execute debug code after key response. You can specify the brightness shortcut key, or other keys when you actually use it.</br>
    **Note**: The name change required by the above patch is in the comments of the corresponding patch file.
- Observe the console output
  - Open the console and search for `ABCD-`
  - Complete the sleep and wake up process once
  - Press the key specified by ***SSDT-BKeyQxx-Debug*** and observe the console output results. In general, the following results are displayed:
	```
	13:19:50.542733+0800 kernel ACPIDebug: { "ABCD-_PTS-Arg0=", 0x3, }
	13:19:55.541826+0800 kernel ACPIDebug: { "ABCD-_WAK-Arg0=", 0x3, }
	```
    The result shown above is the value of `Arg0` after the last sleep and wake cycle.

## Notes and Credits
- Debug code can be diversified, such as `\RMDT.P1`, `\RMDT.P2`, `\RMDT.P3` and so on, see ***SSDT-RMDT.dsl*** for details
- The debugging kext and SSDT were developed by [**RehabMan**](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-ACPI-Debug)
