# Fake Firmware Hub Device (`SSDT-FWHD`) 
Adds `FWHD` device to the IO Registry in macOS â€“ nothing more. My research showed that the Intel Firmware Hub Device is present in the DSDT of almost every Intel-based Mac model. It is listed in IORegistryExplorer as "FWHD" (Firmware Hub Device) with the HID `INT0800`.

## Credits
- Baio1977 for providing the SSDT
