# Preconfigured OpenCore Desktop EFI Folders

## About
I recently stumbled over these pre-configured base OpenCore EFI folders by [Gabriel Luchina](https://github.com/luchina-gabriel) for various Intel systems which might help novice users getting their systems going. 

The configs cover most Desktop systems, look very well created, documented and maintained, so that's why I decided to share them here. All credits go to him for creating and sharing them!
